## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing of grocery transactions
- Calculation of item frequency distributions
- Visualization of most frequent items
- Frequent itemset mining with adjustable support threshold
- Generation of association rules with metrics like support, confidence, and lift
- Plots for visualizing item popularity
